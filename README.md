# MY LEARNING PATH

I have started to code in octobre 2020 and haven't stopped since. This repo stores most of the
projects I worked on until dezember 2021. I have learned quite a bit and am looking forward to
learn even more cool stuff!

Special thanks to The Odin Project, that helped me a lot on this journey.
